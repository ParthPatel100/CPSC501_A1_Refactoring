  - buyingPrive: Item bought price
  - sellingPrive: Price to sell the Item for
  - discountRate: variable rate that changes by a certain amount after every few days
  - daysLastBough: number of days since the item was last bought

## Caveats
- All Food Items have no discount rate and expires after 10 days making their selling Price 0 (cannot sell food that is 10 or more days older )
- All other items have a specific initial discount Rate that increments by a certain amount if not sold after a certain number of days:
  - Any Clothes discount rate will increase by 5% for every 40 days it isn't sold
  - Any Electronics discount rate will increase by 3% for every 60 days it isn't sold
  - Otherwise, for all other items, the discount rate will increase by 2% for every 20 days it's not sold.
- When an Item is being sold:
  - If daysLastBought for an item is 30 days, discount is applied and sold
  - Otherwise, it is sold at the marked selling price
  
- Profit is only calculated based on items sold at sellingPrice minus items available bought at buyingPrice
